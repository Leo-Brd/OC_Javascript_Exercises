OpenClassrooms React Developer formation : project 5

- I did 10 exercises on html / css / javascript bases
- The exercises can be tested with cypress
- To test the exercises, you need to launch the code on 8080 port with this command :
  <br>"*npm run start*"
- then you can run this one to launch cypress :
  <br>"*npm run test*"
